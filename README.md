# BODY FAT PREDICTION

# INTRODUCTION :
Commonly used statistical models to predict body fat percentage currently rely on skinfold measures, anthropometric measures, or some combination of the two but do not account for the wide ranges of age and body mass index (BMI) present in the American adult population. The objective of this study was to develop a statistical regression model to predict in vivo body fat percentage (dual energy X‚Äêray) in men and women across significant age and obesity ranges.
